#Fake_News_Detection

#Dataset used for this project is available on 
[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emineyetm/fake-news-detection-datasets).

#This project classifies news articles as Real or Fake using Machine Learning & NLP techniques.

#Features:-
-> Detects Fake vs. Real News using Machine Learning
-> Uses TF-IDF Vectorization for text processing
-> Trained on Fake and Real News Dataset from Kaggle
-> Achieves 99% accuracy with Logistic Regression
-> Supports easy dataset preprocessing & model training

#Technologies Used:-
-> Python 
-> Scikit-Learn (Logistic Regression, NaÃ¯ve Bayes)
-> Natural Language Processing (NLP)
-> Pandas, NumPy
-> TF-IDF Vectorization

#Future Improvements:-
-> Add Deep Learning (LSTM, BERT) for better generalization
-> Implement a Web App (Flask/Streamlit) for live fake news detection
-> Train on larger & more diverse datasets
